# DeepLearningTutorial

The main goal here is to address both the basics and the advanced parts of deep learning. 
This repository contains a set of tutorials in three main topics:

* deep learning basics (the name of the files starts with DL)
* tutorials on more advanced topics with Pytorch or Scikit-learn (starts with PT)
* tutorials on reinforcement learning (starts with RL)

The number of available tutorials is still growing. 

### Installation guide

If you only want to read the notebooks you can use only this github site and there is no need to download the repository. 
If you decide to try out things you should follow the steps below:

1. Install Anaconda ([guide](https://www.anaconda.com/download/))
2. Optional: create a virtual environment ([guide](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html))
2. The following Python packages are vital:
    * [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) (installation: pip install numpy)
    * [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) (installation: follow carefully the recommendations of the site)
    * [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) (installation: pip install scikit-learn)
    * [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) (installation: pip install matplotlib)
    * [Jupyter-notebook](http://jupyter.org/) (installation: pip install jupyter)
3. Download the tutorial (or clone it)
4. In a terminal navigate to the DeepLearningTutorial folder
5. Execute: pip install -e .
